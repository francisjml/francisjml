## That's me! 🐲

I have always been interested in Cybersecurity, and in October 2025 I began my transition from Helpdesk Support into the Cybersecurity field. 
While I value organized and structured methodologies, I also enjoy thinking outside the box and exploring creative solutions to complex problems. 
Here, I will document most of my learning journey, projects, and experiments as I continue to grow my skills in Cybersecurity.
